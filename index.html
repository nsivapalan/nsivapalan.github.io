		<div class="section">
			<img id="dp" src="assets/img/profilepic.jpg" alt="Nimalen">
			<p id="about">My name is Nimalen and I am currently a sophomore at UC Berkeley, pursuing a BA in Computer Science.
				I was born and raised in Boston before moving to India, then Alabama, and now to the beautiful state of
				California. My passion lies in integrating technology to better the world, which is what led me to join
				the startup I work at, <a href="http://www.smileygo.org" target="_blank">SmileyGo</a>. I strive to better
				myself and am always learning new things about myself and the world.

	<!-- Interests -->
	<!-- Idea behind this is that there will be icons for each of my interests, 
	* of which there are four: reading, writing, web dev. and sleeping lol.
	* then when you hover over the icons, you will see more about them. like for
	* reading, you will see: I've always been an avid reader since I was a kid. 
	* My favorite book is Catcher in The Rye. I'm currently reading Outliers by 
	Malcolm Gladwell. Check out my goodreads!
